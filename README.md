# amazon-clone
A static Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It includes a navigation bar, search section, product cards, hero banner, and footer. Flexbox is used for layout, and Font Awesome icons are used for UI elements. This project helped me practice page structure, styling, and layout design.
